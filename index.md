## My story

<img style="float: right; margin : 5%" width="20%" src="/images/Pavel_Kriz.png">

#### 2016

* I coded first calculator ðŸ˜€

#### 2017 - 2021

* I liked the programming so much -> application to universiy [FIT CTU in Prague (ÄŒVUT)](https://fit.cvut.cz/en)  
* Hearing **computer graphics** is the hardest major at faculty, so I chosen it with sentence "Hard in school, easy on job" in mind
* Going to **Erasmus in Germany** at [RWTH Aachen](https://www.rwth-aachen.de) -  if the already hard school was not hard enough ðŸ˜€
* I have joined the Erasmus Student Network (ESN), which was one of my best decisions ever

#### 2021 - 2023

* **publishing scientific paper** about the innovative application at KES International Conference in Athens
* I finished my masters in **software engineering** at  [FIT CTU in Prague (ÄŒVUT)](https://fit.cvut.cz/en)  

#### 2023 - now

* I moved to Karlsruhe, Germany
* I am working at [Karlsruhe Institute of Technology](https://www.kit.edu/english/index.php) as Computer Scientist. I maintain GitLab service with over 30 nodes and I like it especially for the fact that I can lear new technology every week. It includes a lot of programming as well.
