# Welcome

<img style="float: right;" width="20%" src="/images/Pavel_Kriz.png">

My name is Pavel Kříž and I am a **software engineer** and I mainly deal with the backend, but I am a creative person and I have also dealt with frontend projects and I am even trained in UI/UX development and testing.

## My projects

Besides many of my diverse university projects I found also a part time jobs and other side projects during my studies.

## My story

I started programming quite lately before going to university in 2016. From the first moment I got drawn into it. Later I have finished my bachelors in **computer graphics**, I learned both basic and advanced computer graphics calculation techniques, visualizations, image processing algorithms and others such as user interface development and testing.

Later, I have finished my masters in **software engineering** at the same university [Faculty of Information Technology, **CTU in Prague**](https://fit.cvut.cz/en). I changed my major to software engineering to learn more general knowledge. Second reason was also the fact that I took master courses of computer graphics on my exchange studies (Erasmus) in Germany at [**RWTH Aachen**](https://www.rwth-aachen.de), which completed my knowledge in computer graphics. As a software engineer I have good knowledge of software development techniques, teamwork, design patterns and architectures, diagrams, parallel and distributed computations, good coding standards and many others.

During my studies I got two IT part-time jobs and mainly I have attended a research project for Czech Academy of Sciences where I developed textural features benchmarking cloud application, which is first such application. In the end I **published scientific paper** about the innovative application **at KES International Conference in Athens**.
