My name is Pavel Kříž and I am a software engineer and I mainly deal with the backend, but I am a creative person and I have also dealt with frontend projects and I am even trained in UI/UX development and testing.

## My projects

Besides many of my diverse university projects I found also a part time jobs and other side projects during my studies.

## My story

I started programming quite lately before going to university in 2016. From the first moment I got drawn into it. Later I have finished my bachelors in **computer graphics**, I learned both basic and advanced computer graphics calculation techniques, visualizations, image processing algorithms and others such as user interface development and testing.

Later, I have finished my masters in **software engineering** at the same university [Faculty of Information Technology, **CTU in Prague**](https://fit.cvut.cz/en). I changed my major to software engineering to learn more general knowledge. Second reason was also the fact that I took master courses of computer graphics on my exchange studies (Erasmus) in Germany at [**RWTH Aachen**](https://www.rwth-aachen.de), which completed my knowledge in computer graphics.
