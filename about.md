I have started programming quite lately before going to university in 2016. From the frist moment I got drawn into it. I started programming without reading much about it and I was satisfied with first projects like a calculator.

I have finished my bachelors in **Computer Graphics** at [Faculty of Information Technology, **CTU in Prague**](https://fit.cvut.cz/en) in 2021. Then I have changed my field of study to **Software Engineering**.

## Main projects

I have been working for **CESNET** on a heritage digitization. I have been working on digitazinng such objects like Madonna from the Old Town in Prague.

My **bachelor thesis** was concerned with a solution of a mobile phone localisation using computer vision. The output of the thesis is used in the project [Dowry Towns of Bohemian Queens](https://www.kralovskavennamesta.cz/en/index.html).
