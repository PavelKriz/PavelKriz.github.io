I have started programming quite lately before going on a university in a year 2016. From the frist moment I got drawn into it. I started programming without reading much about it and I was satisfied with first projects like calculator.

I have finished my bachelors in Computer Graphics at [Faculty of Information Technology, CTU in Prague](https://fit.cvut.cz/en) in 2021. Then I have changed my field of study to Software Engineering.
