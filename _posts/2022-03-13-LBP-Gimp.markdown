**The "LBP IN GIMP" plugin is a powerful tool designed for GIMP, the popular image editing software. This plugin allows users to visualize various Local Binary Pattern (LBP) variations in images, making it useful for tasks like texture analysis in fields such as fingerprint recognition and medicine. Whether you need to visualize classic LBP or create artistic images using LBP with custom parameters, this plugin offers a versatile solution. It supports multiple LBP variations and provides a bridge between image processing and artistic creativity.**

**[The github repository](https://github.com/PavelKriz/LBP_GIMP_plugin) of the plugin contains more information and the plugin itself.**

## Local Binary Pattern

Local binary pattern (LBP) is calculated data from the image that represent the image in some exact way. LBP is calculated for every pixel in the image and the output value shows relation of the original pixel to its neighborhood.There is more ways on how to calculate the output value and it leads to different results. The LBP may be used for texture analysis of fingerprints or in medicine. There is nice article on the topic of LBP in [ScienceDirect](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/engineering/local-binary-pattern).

## Plugin

The plugin for Gimp is made in a way that more standard LBP can be visualized (on the left - classic LBP) but also some more specific ones as well (on the right - CLBP-C):

 <img style="float:right;" src="/images/LBP-Gimp/CLBP_C10r8p.JPG" width="49%">

The plugin is made in a way that it can be used just to visualize classic output of LBP but also creation of artistic images using LBP. That can usually be made by setting big radius for the LBP calculation. 

The output is determined by chosen method (LBP variation) and its parameters. The supported LBP variations are following: 

 * LBP
 * mLBP
 * ULBP
 * CLBP
 * CLBP_S, CLBP_M, CLBP_C
