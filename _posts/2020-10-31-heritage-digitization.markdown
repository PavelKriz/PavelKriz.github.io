introduction: 'I have been working for CESNET on a heritage digitization. I have been working on digitizing such objects like Madonna from the Old Town in Prague.'

[Website with digitized models](https://modely.cesnet.cz) containing selected digitized models which have been digitized by CESNET.

I have done or been included on many object digitizations but namely I have worked on the [The Old Town Madonna](https://modely.cesnet.cz/en/staromestska_madona.html) and [New Town Shoemaker's Guild Chest](https://modely.cesnet.cz/en/truhla.html) and I think that these are the nicest of these I worked on. The goal of the work was to **automatize** the digitization process as much as possible, that was done using `Python` scripting.
